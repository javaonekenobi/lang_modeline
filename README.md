# lang_modeline
## a lua plugin for neovim that adds a modeline at the end of a buffer if a modeline for the buffer's language has been configured calling setup.
  
This a very rough, naif, primordial thing, it's my first Lua plugin, lua/neovim experts will probably laugh at it, but it's a start.  
I'll write a minimal documentation as soon as I have time, but I'm such a noob at this stuff that the code is pretty self-explaining.

Maybe someone will find it useful, it is useful to me and its main purpose is to actually learn coding nvim plugins in Lua.

Enjoy
